The atmosphere is made up of several gases, including water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone.\nThe concentration of these gases in the atmosphere has increased over the past century due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), clearing forests, and raising livestock. These activities release CO2 into the atmosphere, which traps heat and contributes to global warming.\nIn addition to CO2, other greenhouse gases contribute to climate change. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is released when organic matter decomposes in landfills or when natural gas or oil is extracted from the ground. Nitrous oxide is released when nitrogen-based fert", '\nThe process of making cheese is called curdling. The milk is heated to a temperature of about 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
